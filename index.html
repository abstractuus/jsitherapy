          we are all about people. Our team of experienced therapists has been
          making a difference for over two decades. We're not just a company;
          we're a dedicated group of professionals who truly care.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          Our mission is to provide top-notch Physical Therapy, Occupational
          Therapy, and Speech Therapy interventions that cater to a wide range
          of clients. Whether it's at our Outpatient Clinic, through our
          Contract Therapy Management Services, or right in the comfort of your
          own home with our Outpatient Therapy services, we're here to make a
          positive impact on your well-being.
        </p>

        <p class="para">
          Speaking of home, that's where our hearts are too. We focus on more
          than just therapy; we're all about creating a safe environment,
          improving strength and balance, and preventing falls. By working
          closely with caregivers, we're not just building physical wellness –
          we're enhancing overall quality of life. And in doing so, we're not
          just helping you stay healthier, we're also playing a role in reducing
          the strain on resources like Medicare and insurance providers.

          JSI isn't just a service provider – we're your partners in better
          health and a brighter future.
